    ;; MORE ABOUT INTERNALS AND ONE WARNING

    ;; internally `rfe/push-state` matches route by calling match-by-name,
    ;; then calls:
    ;; 1) js/window.pushState with found path and
    ;; 2) provided -on-navigate handler

    ;; this navigates to "/ui/apps"
    (rfe/push-state :apps {} nil)

    ;; this navigates to "/ui/apps/sixsq"
    (rfe/push-state :apps-details {:sub-path "sixsq"} nil)


    ;; ...but be warned: this call navigates to "/ui/apps/sixsq%2Fblackbox":
    (rfe/push-state :apps-details {:sub-path "sixsq/blackbox"} nil)
    ;; ...and this to "/ui/apps/sixsq%2FNew%20Project?subtype=project":
    (rfe/push-state :apps-details {:sub-path "sixsq/New Project"} {:subtype "project"})


    ;;;; This happens because reitit uses `js/encodeURIComponent` to turn path param values into a `path`.


    ;; This has two implications:

    ;; 1. to navigate by path, we have a
    ;;    `::push-state` event dispatching `:push-state` effect which manually calls
    ;;    (.pushState js/window.history nil {} path)
    ;;    followed by
    ;;    (rfh/-on-navigate @history path)
    ;;    -> because pushState does not call popState, we have to call -on-navigate manually.
    ;;    That's how it is done in reitit source and also what they recommended via Slack.

    ;; 2. `href` works the same, so be mindful when you use it
    ;;    This means we cannot call this with a :sub-path value comprised of multiple path segments
    ;;    e.g. to navigate to "/ui/apps/this-works/perhaps/unexpected"
    (name->href :apps-details {:sub-path "this-works/perhaps/unexpected"} {:query-param "hello/world"})
    ;; => "/ui/apps/this-works%2Fperhaps%2Funexpected?query-param=hello%2Fworld"
    (name->href :apps-details {:sub-path "sixsq/blackbox"})

    ;; so construct the path using the parent route...
    (str (name->href routes/apps) "/" "this-works/as/expected")
    ;; => "/ui/apps/this-works/as/expected"
    (str (name->href routes/apps) "/" "sixsq/blackbox")

    ;; ...or with pathify helper
    (pathify [(name->href routes/apps) "this-works" "as" "expected"])
    ;; => "/ui/apps/this-works/as/expected"

    ;; or with to-pathname helper, which adds base-path
    (to-pathname ["apps" "this" "works" "too"])
    ;; => "/ui/apps/this/works/too"
    ;; this last one shouldn't be used in new code anymore, because
    ;; we path strings directly, but it's useful in legacy code.
